projet PPML
==============================

Optimize a machine learning model by fusing operations.


## Course : Parallel programming for Machine Learning
### Xavier Dupré and Matthieu Durut.
### Academic year: 2023-2024

### Realised by :

* Choho Yann Eric CHOHO
* Paul Guillermit 

If you want to run it manually on your computer, then follow the step bellow :

```

We mainly used the library Triton which requires Linux system : you can then Install WSL for Windows user
